  "summary": "Implemented a static Tema fleet data module and a reusable TugboatList component, and updated TugboatsPage to render the list from the static data. However, TugboatsPage still contains a paragraph within its main header area, which may violate the requirement to replace the selected first paragraph content with TugboatList output.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Replace ONLY the content within the selected Tugboat page elements (including the first paragraph under the selected <main>) with the new TugboatList output, removing the old placeholder paragraph/content.",
      "reason": "The updated TugboatsPage still renders a <p> element with descriptive text above the TugboatList, which appears to leave non-list paragraph content in the main area rather than fully replacing the selected first paragraph with TugboatList output.",
